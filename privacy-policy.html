        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>The App does not automatically collect any personal information, usage data, or analytics. We do not track your location, device information, or how you use the App.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>All information entered into the App is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To create and manage quotes for your customers</li>
            <li>To generate PDF documents containing quote information</li>
            <li>To store your quote history for future reference</li>
            <li>To enable you to share quotes with your customers via PDF</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> We do not access, collect, transmit, or store any of your data on our servers. All data remains on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Local Storage Only</h3>
        <p>All data entered into the M&M Fence Quote app is stored exclusively on your iPad using iOS local storage (AsyncStorage). Your data is never transmitted to external servers or third parties.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Data Security</h3>
        <p>Your data security depends on the security measures of your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID protection</li>
            <li>Keep your iOS software up to date</li>
            <li>Enable device encryption (enabled by default on iOS)</li>
            <li>Back up your device regularly to prevent data loss</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3 Data Backup</h3>
        <p>Your quote data will be included in your device's iCloud or iTunes backups if you have enabled device backups. This is controlled by your iOS settings, not by the App.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

        <h3>5.1 No Third-Party Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your information with third parties. Since all data is stored locally on your device, we have no access to your information.</p>

        <h3>5.2 PDF Sharing</h3>
        <p>When you generate and share a PDF quote from the App, you control who receives that document. The sharing functionality uses the standard iOS sharing capabilities, and any data shared is at your discretion.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect or have access to your data, we cannot be compelled to share it with law enforcement or other parties.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not integrate with or use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. We use only standard iOS frameworks for core functionality:</p>

            <li><strong>expo-sharing:</strong> Uses iOS native sharing capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>None of these services transmit your data to external servers.</p>
